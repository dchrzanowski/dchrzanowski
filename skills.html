                                    I started coding at a very early age, and to me the world of code is fascinating as it provides limitless possibilities. However, a lot of persistence and determination is required as the industry changes on a daily basis. This means that if you want to be a programmer you are signing up for a lifelong education, since the learning never stops.

                                    During the past few years in College and VTOS I have added a lot of knowledge about programming. Currently I am working on a few mini-projects to continuously extend my knowledge. The languages I currently have a good knowledge of are Python, Java, JavaScript, C# and TypeScript, but I also have a basic understanding and working knowledge of C/C++ and PHP. The current state of the industry requires extensive knowledge of Java, therefore I am concentrating my efforts here at the moment.
                                </p>

                                    By far my greatest interest and passion for programming lies within Architecture Design and Agile Methodologies. As a beginner coder I had very little appreciation for Software Development Life Cycles (SDLCs). An SDLCs describes how software is made at all stages of the process. Agile Methodology is one of many SDLC concepts and theorethically it is one of the best, as it suits both small and big projects. In a standard SDLC the project is made from top to bottom with very little to no interaction with the customer. Agile focuses on short iterations called sprints in which a set of requirements is implemented, then tested, deployed, and finally presented to the customer where feedback is gathered. After an evaluation of the previous sprint, a new sprint starts. This ciculatory nature of Agile allows for a more polished product and removes any potentiall misunderstanding between the customer's idea and the final product. This saves time and money in the long run.

                                    I have been aware of Digital Media since I was a child. Fortunately, I was born in a time when Digital Media was booming. I was first mesmerised by computer animation when I was six years old and immediately I asked my father for a computer. By the time I had reached secondary school I had made dozens of images, sound samples and animations. Computer assisted creation was just so gripping! Currently I am developing and rapidly expanding my skills in various aspects of Digital Media including GIMP, Krita, Audacity and Flash.

                                <p>
                                    Web Development is something that goes hand in hand with Digital Media. The modification of images, sound samples or short animations is frequently required when creating a website. Developing websites is a skill that I have only recently acquired and I can see that there is so much to learn and the industry is not just moving forward, it is leaping! The most difficult aspect of making websites is the customer interaction, gathering requirements and maintaining good communication.

                                    I struggled with the idea of coming back to education after a long break. As a child I had problems with my handwriting and this resulted in bad grades to my increasing frustration. This led to me eventually giving up on my education. Now that I had been given a second chance the anxiety surrounding my handwriting skills still lingered. After writing my first essay in VTOS titled "ICT, the World Wide Web and issues people with disabilities face" I gained a major confidence boost. I received a lot of help and support from my wife, and she assured me that I can do it! The second essay that I completed was "A Study Comparing Psychotherapy and Medication for the Treatment of Depression. What Works Better?", it was based around the real life struggle of one of my family members. That was the moment when I really learned how to write, revise and edit my work so that it was clear and informative.

                                    After the discovery of Org Mode within the Emacs Editor I have shifted all of my communication, organization and planning needs to Emacs. Org Mode allows me to take notes, create lists, schedule events, plan deadlines, create agendas, link documents, produce reports, export data to HTML/Latex/PDF/Doc, and many many more. The productivity boost provided by Org Mode and Emacs is unparalleled.

                                    At the core of it all - Maths! The whole world can be described with numbers. Literally everything that is surrounding us can be described by means of numbers or mathematical equations. To think that Mathematics was considered a philosophy centuries ago seems frankly bizarre.

                                    I would consider myself to be a logical thinker and a problem solver. My mind is not at rest when I am presented with a problem that cannot be solved. It will bother me until I find and work out a solution. In my opinion this is why I have a proficiency for Mathematics and Programming. I don't want to just do it or learn it, I need to understand how it works. Mathematics at third level was a major step-up and I looked forward to participating in every class.
