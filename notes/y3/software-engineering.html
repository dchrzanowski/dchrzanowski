<li><a href="#orgad9e916">12.2. Explain how the principles underlying agile methods lead to the accelerated development and deployment of software.</a></li>
<li><a href="#org25c5bf5">12.3. Extreme programming expresses user requirements as stories, with each story written on a card. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this approach to requirements description.</a></li>
<li><a href="#org0ebcdac">12.4. Explain why program inspections are an effective technique for discovering errors in a program. What types of error are unlikely to be discovered through inspections?</a></li>
<li><a href="#org835f264">12.5. Explain why it is difficult to validate the relationships between internal product attributes, such as cyclomatic complexity and external attributes, such as maintainability.</a></li>
<li><a href="#org9c1e322">12.6. Explain how standards may be used to capture organizational wisdom about effective methods of software development. Suggest four types of knowledge that might be captured in organizational standards.</a></li>
<li><a href="#org6e09e58">12.7. Assume you work for an organization that develops database products for individuals and small businesses. This organization is interested in quantifying its software development. Identify appropriate process and product metrics to do this and suggest how these can be collected.</a></li>
<li><a href="#org34d5006">12.8. When would you recommend against the use of an agile method for developing a software system?</a></li>
<li><a href="#orgcbfad2f">12.9. Suggest four reasons why the productivity rate of programmers working as a pair might be more than half that of two programmers working individually.</a></li>
<li><a href="#org3dfdad8">12.10. It has been suggested that one of the problems of having a user closely involved with a software development team is that they 'go native'. That is, they adopt the outlook of the development team and lose sight of the needs of their user colleagues. Suggest three ways how you might avoid this problem and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.</a></li>
<li><a href="#org6aa61a7">12.11. Under what circumstances might a company justifiably charge a much higher price for a software system than the software cost estimate plus a reasonable profit margin?</a></li>
<li><a href="#org4f5f12c">12.12. Cost estimates are inherently risky, irrespective of the estimation technique used. Suggest five ways in which the risk in a cost estimate can be reduced.</a></li>
<li><a href="#orgb050840">12.13. What is the most important difference between generic software product development and custom software development? What might this mean in practice for users of generic software products?</a></li>
<li><a href="#org6e7f824">12.14. Giving reasons for your answer based on the type of system being developed, suggest the most appropriate generic software process model that might be used as a basis for managing the development of the following systems:</a></li>
<li><a href="#org9fc8eac">12.15. Fixed-price contracts, where the contractor bids a fixed price to complete a system development, may be used to move project risk from client to contractor. If anything goes wrong, the contractor has to pay. Suggest how the use of such contracts may increase the likelihood that product risks will arise.</a></li>
<li><a href="#org11776c7">12.16. What are the important differences between the agile approach and the process maturity approach to software process improvement?</a></li>
<li><a href="#orgc90e941">12.17. Describe three types of software process metric that may be collected as part of a process improvement process. Give one example of each type of metric.</a></li>
<li><a href="#orgde5790f">12.18. Discuss, in relation to the ACM/IEEE Code of Ethics, the ethics of a company releasing software without disclosing known defects. Your answer should address each of the principles of the ACM/IEEE Code of Ethics. Justify any assumptions that you make.</a></li>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
What is Software?
</p>
<p class="verse">
Computer programs and associated documentation. Software products may be developed for a particular customer or may be developed for a general market.<br />
</p></li>

<li><p>
What are the attributes of good software?
</p>
<p class="verse">
Good software should deliver the required functionality and performance to the user and should be maintainable, dependable and usable.<br />
</p></li>

<li><p>
What is software engineering?
</p>
<p class="verse">
Software engineering is an engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspects of software production.<br />
</p></li>

<li><p>
What are the fundamental software engineering activities?
</p>
<p class="verse">
Software specification, software development, software validation and software evolution.<br />
</p></li>

<li><p>
What is the difference between software engineering and computer science?
</p>
<p class="verse">
Computer science focuses on theory and fundamentals; software engineering is concerned with the practicalities of developing and delivering useful software.<br />
</p></li>

<li><p>
What is the difference between software engineering and system engineering?
</p>
<p class="verse">
System engineering is concerned with all aspects of computer-based systems development including hardware, software and process engineering. Software engineering is part of this more general process.<br />
</p></li>

<li><p>
What are the key challenges facing software engineering?
</p>
<p class="verse">
Coping with increasing diversity, demands for reduced delivery times and developing trustworthy software.<br />
</p></li>

<li><p>
What are the costs of software engineering?
</p>
<p class="verse">
Roughly 60% of software costs are development costs, 40% are testing costs. For custom software, evolution costs often exceed development costs.<br />
</p></li>

<li><p>
What are the best software engineering techniques and methods?
</p>
<p class="verse">
While all software projects have to be professionally managed and developed, different techniques are appropriate for different types of system. For example, games should always be developed using a series of prototypes whereas safety critical control systems require a complete and analyzable specification to be developed. You can’t, therefore, say that one method is better than another.<br />
</p></li>

<li><p>
What differences has the web made to software engineering?
</p>
<p class="verse">
The web has led to the availability of software services and the possibility of developing highly distributed service-based systems. Web-based systems development has led to important advances in programming languages and software reuse.<br />

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Increasing System Complexity</b>: As new software engineering techniques help us to build larger, more complex systems, the demands change. Systems have to be built and delivered more quickly; larger, even more complex systems are required; systems have to have new capabilities that were previously thought to be impossible.</li>
<li><b>Failure to use software engineering methods</b>: It is fairly easy to write computer programs without using software engineering methods and techniques. Many companies have drifted into software development as their products and services have evolved. They do not use software engineering methods in their everyday work. Consequently, their software is often more expensive and less reliable than it should be.</li>

</div></li>
<li><b>Software Development</b>: Where the software is designed and programmed
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The process of converting the system specification into an executable system</li>
<li><b>Software Design</b>: Design a software structure that realizes the specification</li>
<li><b>Implementation</b>: Translate this structure into an executable program</li>
<li><b>Design</b> and <b>Implementation</b> are interleaved</li>
<li><b>Programming</b>: is an individual activity with no standard process</li>
<li><b>Debugging</b>: is the activity of finding program faults and correcting these faults</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Software Validation</b>: Where the software is checked to ensure that it fulfills requirements
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Verification and Validation (V&amp;V)</b>: Is intended to show that a system conforms to its specification and meets the requirements of the system</li>
<li>Involves checking and reviewing processes and system testing</li>
<li>System testing involves executing the system with tests made from the specification</li>
<li><b>Testing</b> is the most common <b>V&amp;V</b> activity</li>
<li><b>Testing stages are</b>: Component testing, System testing, Customer testing</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Software Evolution</b>: Where the software is modified to reflect changing customer and market requirements
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Software is flexible and can change</li>
<li>As requirements change throughout changing business circumstances so must the software evolve.</li>
<li>Change leads to rework and re-analysis, and thus a cost increase</li>
<li>To reduce the costs anticipate change: for example, develop a prototype first</li>
<li>To reduce the costs implement "change tolerance": this normally occurs in the incremental SDLCs, where the proposed changes may be implemented in increments</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-12-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Individual and interactions over processes and tools</b>: By taking advantages of individual skills and ability and by ensuring that the development team knows what each other are doing, the overheads of formal communication and process assurance are avoided. This means that the team can focus on the development of working software.</li>
<li><b>Working software over comprehensive documentation</b>: This contributes to accelerated development because time is not spent developing, checking and managing documentation. Rather, the programmer’s time is focused on the development and testing of code.</li>
<li><b>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation</b>: Rather than spending time developing, analyzing and negotiating requirements to be included in a system contract, agile developers argue that it is more effective to get feedback from customer’s directly during the development about what is required. This allows useful functionality to be developed and delivered earlier than would be possible if contracts were required.</li>
<li><b>Responding to change over following a plan</b>: Agile developers argue (rightly) that being responsive to change is more effective than following a plan-based process because change is inevitable whatever process is used. There is significant overhead in changing plans to accommodate change and the inflexibility of a plan means that work may be done that is later discarded.</li>

<p>
Program inspections are effective for the following reasons:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>They can <b>find several faults in one pass</b> without being concerned about interference between program faults.</li>
<li>They bring a <b>number of people with different experience</b> of different types of errors. Hence, the team approach offers greater coverage than any individual can bring.</li>
<li>They force the program <b>author to re-examine</b> the program in detail – this often reveals errors or misunderstandings.</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-12-5">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The basic difficulty arises because the external attributes such as maintainability are <b>not just dependent on a small number of internal product attributes</b>. While the <b>complexity of a system influences its maintainability</b>, other issues such as the use of variable names, the system documentation and, particularly, the skills of the people doing the maintenance <b>have such a large effect</b> on the process that they may mask any maintainability differences arising from different levels of complexity.

Individual programmers have to spend time explicitly sharing information and they are not being productive when doing so.</li>
<li>Pair programming encourages <b>refactoring</b> (the code must be understandable to another person). This <b>reduces the costs of subsequent</b> development and means that future changes can be made quickly. Hence, efficiency is increased.</li>
<li>In pair programming, people are likely to spend <b>less time in fine-grain optimization</b> as this does not benefit the other programmer. This means that the <b>pair focuses on the essential features</b> of the system which they can then produce more quickly.</li>

<h3 id="orgb050840"><span class="section-number-3">12.13</span> What is the most important difference between generic software product development and custom software development? What might this mean in practice for users of generic software products?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-12-13">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The essential difference is that in <b>generic software product development</b>, the specification is <b>owned by the product developer</b>. For <b>custom product development</b>, the specification is <b>owned and controlled by the customer</b>. The implications of this are significant – the developer can quickly decide to change the specification in response to some external change (e.g. a competing product) but, when the customer owns the specification, changes have to be negotiated between the customer and the developer and may have contractual implications.</li>
<li>For users of generic products, this means they have no control over the software specification so cannot control the evolution of the product. The developer may decide to include/exclude features and change the user interface. This could have implications for the user’s business processes and add extra training costs when new versions of the system are installed. It also may limit the customer’s flexibility to change their own business processes.</li>

<h3 id="org6e7f824"><span class="section-number-3">12.14</span> Giving reasons for your answer based on the type of system being developed, suggest the most appropriate generic software process model that might be used as a basis for managing the development of the following systems:</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-12-14">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Anti-lock braking system</b>: This is a safety-critical system so requires a lot of up-front analysis before implementation. It certainly needs a plan-driven approach to development with the requirements carefully analysed. A waterfall model is therefore the most appropriate approach to use, perhaps with formal transformations between the different development stages.</li>
<li><b>Virtual reality system</b>: This is a system where the requirements will change and there will be an extensive user interface components. Incremental development with, perhaps, some UI prototyping is the most appropriate model. An agile process may be used.</li>
<li><b>University accounting system</b>: This is a system whose requirements are fairly well-known and which will be used in an environment in conjunction with lots of other systems such as a research grant management system. Therefore, a reuse-based approach is likely to be appropriate for this.</li>
<li><b>Interactive travel planning system</b>: System with a complex user interface but which must be stable and reliable. An incremental development approach is the most appropriate as the system requirements will change as real user experience with the system is gained.</li>

<h3 id="org9fc8eac"><span class="section-number-3">12.15</span> Fixed-price contracts, where the contractor bids a fixed price to complete a system development, may be used to move project risk from client to contractor. If anything goes wrong, the contractor has to pay. Suggest how the use of such contracts may increase the likelihood that product risks will arise.</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-12-15">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Fixed-price contracts</b> are attractive to potential software development clients because it guarantees them a predetermined budget and also allows for all the risk to be taken up by the contractor. Fixed-price contracts mean that the contractor takes on any extra costs that could incur because of changes in requirements or technology that affect the timeline for the project's completion. While this may be a benefit for the customer, who will have more power to change their mind and project requirements, it is much more likely that product risks will arise because of bad communication, changes in plans, and off-schedule development. And all of these problems will be up to the contractor to take care of, which does not seem like a smart business plan.</li>

<h3 id="org11776c7"><span class="section-number-3">12.16</span> What are the important differences between the agile approach and the process maturity approach to software process improvement?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-12-16">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The fundamental difference in these approaches is that the agile approach is <b>people-centric</b> and the process maturity approach is <b>process centric</b>. In the agile approach, practices are introduced that are geared to supporting communication between people, making it easier for them to make changes to the software and minimizing the time that they need to spend doing things apart from software production (e.g. documentation).</li>
<li>The process maturity approach is <b>based on defined processes</b> that <b>incorporate good practice</b> and in ensuring that these <b>processes are followed by all of the teams</b> in an organization. They assume that by defining process and good practice, all engineers involved in development can perform in a comparable way. That is, they do not focus on the capabilities of the individual engineers but rather on being able to maintain consistent practice even although the team changes.</li>

<h3 id="orgc90e941"><span class="section-number-3">12.17</span> Describe three types of software process metric that may be collected as part of a process improvement process. Give one example of each type of metric.</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-12-17">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Source Code Metrics</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When measuring source code quality make sure you’re looking at the <b>number of lines of code</b> you have, which will ensure that you have the appropriate amount of code and it’s no more complex than it needs to be. Another thing to track is how <b>compliant each line of code is with the programming languages’ standard usage rules</b>. Equally important is to track the <b>percentage of comments within the code</b>, which will tell you how much maintenance the program will require. The less comments, the more problems when you decide to change or upgrade. Other things to include in your measurements is <b>code duplicates and unit test coverage</b>, which will tell you how smoothly your product will run (and at when are you likely to encounter issues).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Development Metrics</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Measuring <b>number of defects within the code and time to fix them</b> tells you a lot about the development process itself. Start by <b>tallying up the number of defects that appear in the code and note the time</b> it takes to fix them. If any <b>defects have to be fixed multiple times then there might be a misunderstanding of requirements or a skills gap</b> – which is important to address as soon as possible.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Testing Metrics</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>There are two major testing metrics. One of them is <b>"test coverage"</b> that collects data about which parts of the software program are executed when it runs a test. The second part is a test of the <b>testing itself</b>. It’s called <b>"defect removal efficiency,"</b> and it checks your success rate for spotting and removing defects. The more you measure, the more you know about your software product, the more likely you are able to improve it. Automating the measurement process is the best way to measure software quality - it’s not the easiest thing, or the cheapest, but it’ll save you tons of cost down the line.</li>
