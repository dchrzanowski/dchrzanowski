* Ludology

** Definition
   Ludology is an academic view of the games.

** Info
   Some people say that making games is an art, knack or a craft.
   Game design DOES require talent.
   People play games for different reasons and require different a different "fix".
   Varius genres fill a different desire.

** Genres
   These days games mix genres. They are called hybrids.
   On the top level there are realistically only a few genres.

   Some examples:
   - Action games are very popular and are very fast paced.
   - FPS (first person shooters), also very popular and fast paced
   - Adventure games
   - Role Playing Games (RPGs)
   - Strategy (RTS, turn based strategies, etc.)
   - Simulation games
   - Sport games
   - Fighting games (beat-em-up)
   - Casual games
   - God games
   - Educational games
   - Platform games (side-scrollers, etc.)

** Popular aspects
   Hunter gatherer, human roots, evolving skills, physical fun, social fun, multipurpose fun

** Choices in games
*** Convexity
    Arguably the most popular and the most fun of ways of orginizing choices in games.
    Start at one point, branch out and finish at the same place.
    Examples: building a technology tree, exploring an island.
    Many games have many convexities or so called chains of convexities.
    Example here would be a gradual progressiona and ending up fighting a boss and the starting a new convexity.

*** Flow Channel
    Start with a low difficulty and gradually increase it as the game does progress.
    One needs to be careful not to increase the difficulty to quickly.
    It is a common practice as we (humans), like to evolve and progress.

** Storytelling
   Blend storytelling with design early. Use experienced interactive writers (prefereably).
   The shouldn't make choices for the player. A story should add an emotional context to the choices the user makes.

** Gameplay
   Gameplay always trumps story.
* Gameplay Design

  - Many designers prefer a player-centric approach to game design
    - You are not your player. Do not assume that others player are like you
    - Your player is not your opponent
  - Entertain the player
    - Know what they want
    - Know what they expect
    - Anticipate the reactions
  - Duty to Empathize
    - Do not make it too hard
    - Do not make it tedious to play
    - Empathising makes the production generally faster and cheaper
  - Remember motivations
    - Easy to learn
    - Difficult to master
  - Feedback
    - Visual
    - Audible
    - Tips, etc.
    - A game should inform the player, especially if it seems too difficult to operate
  - Grounding the Player
    - A player should always know what they are supposed to do
    - A player should always know where they should go next
    - Player should always have a goal
  - Moment-to-moment experience
    - At every moment in the game tha player should have something to do
    - Avoid overfrustrating
    - Avoid boredom and frustration
  - Immersion
    - The game completely involves the player
    - "Sucks the player in and doesn't let go", so to speak
  - Realism
    - Realistic physics
    - Minimise bugs
    - Minimise glitches
    - Attention to detail
    - Audio (need to be spot on)
      - Voice talent
    - Graphics (people generally don't mind the surreal)
  - Writing
    - Good writing is invisible
    - Bad writing is very wisible
