* Definitions
  - *Organization*: Is a systematic arrangement of people brought together to accomplish some specific purpose
* Introduction to Teams
** What's important
   - People. People drive projects.
   - Project managers are people
   - Poor management leads to failure
   - Teamwork is key
** Teamwork
   - Outperform individuals
   - Can utilize individual's talents better
   - Effective tool for motivation
     - Involve
     - Learn
     - Social aspect
** Critical Aspects of People Management
   - *Consistency*: no favourites, no discrimination
   - *Respect*: respect differences
   - *Inclusion*: Involve people and their views
   - *Honesty*: Be honest what is well and what is not
** Team Selection
*** Information Gathering
    - Provided by candidates
    - Gained during an interview
    - Recommendations and comments from others
    - Sample a hiree's previous work
*** Factors
    - *Application Domain Experience*
    - *Platform experience*
    - *Programming language experience*
    - *Problem solving ability*
    - *Education background*
    - *Communication ability*
    - *Adaptability*
    - *Attitude*
    - *Personality*
** Motivation
   - A manager should motivate people that work on a project
   - Motivation is complex, but it is based on:
     - *Basic needs*: food, sleep, etc.
     - *Personal needs*: respect, self-esteem, etc.
     - *Social needs*: be accepted, be tolerated, etc.
*** Maslow's needs (in order of importance)
    1. Physiological needs
    2. Safety needs
    3. Social needs
    4. Esteem needs
    5. Self-actuation needs
** Personality Types (Sommerville)
   - Needs hierarchy is an over-simplification of motivation
   - Should also take into consideration personality types:
     - *Task-oriented*: work itself is the motivator
     - *Self-oriented*: work is a means to an end, e.g. get rich
     - *Interaction-oriented*: presence and action with co-workers
** Motivation Balance
   - Individuals change and so can their motivation
   - Personal circumstances and external events can be a contributor
   - The group in which you work is perhaps one of the biggest motivators
** Group Work
   - Usually Software Engineering is a group activity
   - Group interaction is key
   - Flexibility in group composition is limited
*** Factors
    - *Group Composition*: should contain members with different motivations.
      - Task-oriented: everyone wants to do their own thing
      - Self-oriented: everyone want to be the boss
      - Interaction-oriented: too much chatting, not enough work
    - *Group Cohesiveness*: group is more important that individuals
      - Group quality standards can be developed
      - Work closely together improves lack of ignorance
      - Learn from each other
      - Improve by social events, team-building activities, etc.
    - *Group Communications*: essential aspect, also improves cohesion. Important factors:
      - Group size
      - Group structure
      - Group composition
      - The physical work environment
    - *Group Organization*: Small companies may have self organizing groups, large companies may have hierarchical structure
** Informal Groups
   - Act as whole, come to consensus on decisions affecting the system
   - Leader serves as an external interface, does not allocate work
   - Work is distributed by the group itself
   - This kind of group works when everyone is experienced
* Time Planning
** Benefits of planning
*** Analysis of the project
    - Reveal opportunities for improvement
    - Reveal possible problem preventions
    - Set out a basis on how the project will proceed
    - The benefits are realised when they are communicated
** Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
   - Breakdown large activities into smaller (manageable) units
     - Gives people responsibility for small tasks
     - Better financial control of smaller units
     - Provides a list of work packages
     - Example 1 of WBS:

       [[file:images/Time_Planning/2019-12-12_15-26-55_screenshot.png]]

     - Example 2 of WBS:

       [[file:images/Time_Planning/2019-12-12_15-27-33_screenshot.png]]
** Time Planning
   - Key aspect of project management
   - Assist the manager and the team to complete the project in a timely manner
*** Constructing a plan
    - How long will it take to complete the project?
      - How precise?
      - How long did it take the last time?
      - What could cause delays?
      - What things could get in the ways?
    - Estimates are guesses
      - Do not treat these in a scientific way
      - Estimation continues on throughout the lifecycle of a project
      - The closer to completion, the more accurate the estimate
      - Examples of estimates:
      | Name                                 | Nature                                                          | Role                       | Accuracy |
      |--------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------+----------|
      | Rough / finger-in-the-air / ballpark | Much uncertainty as to what is involved                         | Early check on feasibility | Very low |
      |--------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------+----------|
      | As-buts                              | As above, but with some quantitative data                       | Can be used for proposals  | Moderate |
      |--------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------+----------|
      | Detailed estimates                   | Some initial work is done to determine what problems will occur | Proposals                  | Moderate |
      |--------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------+----------|
      | ... to finish                        | Much of the work is done, additional funding is needed          | Additional fund request    | High     |
** Gantt Charts
   - Illustrates relationships between activities and time
   - Horizontal bar is time
   - Blocks are activities
   - Example Data Input:

     [[file:images/Time_Planning/2019-12-12_15-43-37_screenshot.png]]
   - Example Chart (Logical links are indicated by arrows):

     [[file:images/Time_Planning/2019-12-12_15-44-11_screenshot.png]]
   - *Positives*:
     - Communicates the plan
     - Easy to make
     - Readily understood
     - Widely used
     - Graphical interface for most project planning software
   - *Limitations*:
     - Difficult to update manually
     - Does not equate time to cost
     - Does not help in optimizing resource allocation
     - Perceived as 'Reality' where in fact it is only an estimation
** Tasks, Milestones and Deliverables
*** Definitions
    - *Task*: an activity that contributes towards a *deliverable*
*** Milestone
    - Synchronization point. Milestones mark moments when the project moves from one phase to another
    - Is achieved when a key task is completed
    - Are set along the critical path
    - Why set milestones?
      - *Scheduling*: Setting milestones can help to keep a project on schedule. Reaching milestones gives a change to re-evaluate the plan and identify problems.
      - *Celebrating Success*: Give yourself a pat on the back, good work, celebrate a little.
      - *Project Evaluation*: Re-evaluate what is going well, what problems are encountered, are tasks realistic, time estimation issues?
    - Downside of milestones:
      - Over-complication on small projects: Small projects may become too difficult when broken down too much. Keep it simple.
      - Non-critical task slippage: take into consideration ALL tasks upon milestone reviews. Some important tasks might slip through.
*** Critical Path
    - Longest sequences of activities that must be completed on time for the project to be delivered on time
    - *Critical path* is the longest path to complete the project.
    - To complete a project on time strictly monitor *tasks* and the *critical path*
    - How to:
      - All tasks are assigned a duration of time
      - Connection between tasks are drawn, aka dependencies
      - Calculate the critical path by following the tasks dependent path (connected)
      - Add the durations of the tasks to get the critical path's time
      - Example (tasks are the blocks, critical path in red, 22/09 is a milestone):

        [[file:images/Time_Planning/2019-12-12_15-56-53_screenshot.png]]
* High Performance Teams
** Form-Storm-Norm-Perform Model
*** Assumptions
    - Every group goes through some or all parts of the model
    - The more people know each other and the more they work together the less time is spent through the first 3 stages
    - Each stage is critical, if a team does not go through the first three stages then it may *NEVER* become a high performance team
*** Stages Overview
    - Some team members go through stages at different times
    - Teambuilding, ground rules, task understanding and members commitment is key to stage one
    - Stages may happen in a random order or play out simultaneously
    - It is important to know how to deal with *Storming*. How to handle conflict, e.g.: dialogue and mutual decision-making are the strongest methods.
*** Stage Breakdown
    | Stage      | Description                                                          | Team Behaviour           |

* Needs
** TODO Maslow
** McClelland's Needs Theory
*** Approach
    - First identify a person's needs on your team
    - Structure your approach
