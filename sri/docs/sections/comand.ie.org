    - TG Logo needs to link to Technology Gateway Website, not EI
    - Welcome
    - What we do
    - Goals: Is there a more user friendly way of displaying the Thematic themes? Layout like this is suitable on a sub page but again with the structure how it is, it makes it text heavy and clunky. Have a look at how MET Gateway treats their themes - https://metcentre.ie/ with individual sub pages.
    - Media
    - Twitter feed
*** Services
    Confusing layout, reorder to:

    - Technology Gateway
    - Technology Centre

      - Innovation Voucher
      - Innovation Partnership
      - Agile Innovation Fund
      - Commericalisation Fund
    - Contract Research
    - Technology Licensing
    - EU programme
*** Research
    - Research as presented on the old website, just modernize it
*** News (Blog)
    - Blog style news page
    - Each article contains: an image, a title, category (if any) and content itself
*** Projects
    - Testimonials
    - Project History (more info on projects if possible!)
*** Contact
